## privateSMOTE

The goal of PrivateSMOTE is to create new synthetic cases based on SMOTE strategy by interpolating the highest-risk cases. PrivateSMOTE allows having new cases similar to the originals while preserving privacy and maximising predictive utility. Most importanly, PrivateSMOTE proved to be energetically-efficient and less time-consuming than conventional de-identification approaches.
